## Kotlin

Solutions are written in Kotlin.


## Puzzle framework

A small framework is created to speed up solving a day's puzzle:

* Input is automatically read from the AoC API
* Unit tests using each day's sample input to verify solutions
* Answers are automatically uploaded and outcome is shown
* Common package for utitilities and datastructures

Additionally, uses IntelliJ [live templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html):
  * Template to solve a day's puzzle
  * Template for unit tests with sample input for a day's solution
